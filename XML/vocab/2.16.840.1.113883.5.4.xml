            encourages the use its HMO network to maintain discounted fees with participating providers, but recognizes that sometimes covered parties
            want to choose their own provider. The POS plan allows a covered party to use providers who are not part of the HMO network
            (non-participating providers). However, there is a greater cost associated with choosing these non-network providers. A covered party will
            usually pay deductibles and coinsurances that are substantially higher than the payments when he or she uses a plan provider. Use of
            non-participating providers often requires the covered party to pay the provider directly and then to file a claim for reimbursement, like
